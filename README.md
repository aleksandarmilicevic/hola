# Alloy*

Alloy* is a fully automatic higher-order solver over finite relational
domains.  Alloy* retains the language of Alloy (predicate logic +
relational algebra); it implements CEGIS on top of Kodkod to permit
higher-order quantification.  Alloy* imposes no restrictions on where
higher-order quantifiers may be found or how deeply they may be
nested.
